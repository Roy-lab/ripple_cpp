makeRowPartitions: Generates k row-wise partitions of a data set into training and testing folds.

* Assumes there are headers on the input data file.
* Two modes: randomize the order of the examples prior to partitioning (foldsRand), or not (foldsOrdered).
* For random mode, if the random seed is not provided as an argument, will use getpid() as the seed.


foldsRand will randomize the row IDs and generate N exclusive training/testing folds.
foldsOrdered will not randomize the row IDs and will also generate N exclusive training/testing folds.

USAGE:
./makeRowPartitions input_geneexp num_folds output_dir subsetsize mode [seed]
input_geneexp: string, matrix file with headers, row names, and numeric data
numfolds: int, number of folds/samples to generate
output_dir: directory for output (should exist already)
subsetsize: for rand mode, size of random sample
mode: string, one of: rand, exclusive, foldsRand, foldsOrdered
seed: integer, random seed

modes are:
foldsRand : randomize column IDs, then divide total rows into <numfolds> subsets and produce both training/testing files for each
foldsOrdered : same but without randomizing row IDs
