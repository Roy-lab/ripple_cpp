This directory contains all of the training data for 5C and HiC cell lines from Roy et al 2015 (RIPPLE paper).

benchmark_datalist.txt 
	Gives short names and file locations for cell-line specific training data. This will be used by the benchmarking scripts to set up experiments.

ripple_predictor_network.txt
	Important for the Random Forest running. Specifies which columns of a data file can be used to predict others. Here, we use all features to predict the Class.

All other files in this directory are training datasets for each cell line:
	5C:
	Gm12878_enhanceronly_features.txt
	K562_enhanceronly_features.txt
	Helas_enhanceronly_features.txt
	H1hesc_enhanceronly_features.txt

	HiC:
